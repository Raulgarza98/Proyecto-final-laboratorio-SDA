2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-11#1 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance temp_unsigned0 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.881 ns between temp_unsigned0/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and temp_menor_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.023 ns between temp_unsigned0/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and state_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
